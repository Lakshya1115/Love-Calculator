# Flutter App Version of [Friend's Python Tkinter Project]

Welcome to the **Flutter App** version of the Python Tkinter project. This repository is a reimagined version of an existing Python Tkinter project, now built with Flutter to provide a more modern and user-friendly mobile experience. The original logic remains the same, but weâ€™ve transformed it into an Android application (.apk) with a sleek UI and improved functionality.

## Overview

This Flutter app is designed to provide the same functionality as the original Python Tkinter project, but with enhanced user experience, performance, and accessibility on mobile devices. It serves as an interactive app that replicates the core logic while giving it a polished, mobile-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Replicates Python Tkinter Logic**: The core logic of the Python Tkinter app is retained, ensuring the appâ€™s behavior remains the same.
- **Android Support**: The app is optimized for Android, and can be compiled into an APK file for easy installation.
- **Interactive UI**: Flutterâ€™s flexible widgets help deliver an intuitive and modern mobile interface.
- **Cross-Platform**: While currently focused on Android, this app can be adapted to work on iOS as well with minor adjustments.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/flutter-tkinter-app.git
    cd flutter-tkinter-app
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Flutter installed and your environment is set up correctly. If not, follow the installation guide at [Flutter Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

    Run the following command to get the dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the App**:
    Once the dependencies are installed, run the app on an emulator or physical device:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

4. **Build APK**:
    To generate an APK for Android, use the following command:
    ```bash
    flutter build apk
    ```

    After the build process completes, you can find the APK in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory.
