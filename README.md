# Flutter App Version of [Friend's Python Tkinter Project]

Welcome to the **Flutter App** version of the Python Tkinter project. This repository is a reimagined version of an existing Python Tkinter project, now built with Flutter to provide a more modern and user-friendly mobile experience. The original logic remains the same, but we’ve transformed it into an Android application (.apk) with a sleek UI and improved functionality.

## Overview

This Flutter app is designed to provide the same functionality as the original Python Tkinter project, but with enhanced user experience, performance, and accessibility on mobile devices. It serves as an interactive app that replicates the core logic while giving it a polished, mobile-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Replicates Python Tkinter Logic**: The core logic of the Python Tkinter app is retained, ensuring the app’s behavior remains the same.
- **Android Support**: The app is optimized for Android, and can be compiled into an APK file for easy installation.
